## Overview
This repository contains materials of assignments 1 and 2 for the UBC course *[STAT 545B](https://stat545.stat.ubc.ca/syllabus-545b/)* in the Winter term 2021. The assignments aim to provide knowledge about functions in `R`, including writing and documenting functions. Below is the exhaustive list of tasks that have been done during each assignment.

- [x] Assignment 1
  * Made a function in `R`
  * documented the function using `roxygen2` tags
  * Demonstrated the usage of the function with examples
  * Wrote tests for the function using `testthat` package
- [] Assignment 2
 
 ## Assignment Files
 Files are separated into two folders based on the corresponding assignment. In each assignment folder, you can find below files:
1. *Github markdown (.md)*: [Assignment 1](/Assignment%201/AssignmentB1.Rmd)
2. *R markdown file (.rmd)*: [Assignment 1](/Assignment%201/AssignmentB1.md)
3. *Figure files*: Each Milestone file contains a folder to save plots produced by the `.rmd` file to render them in the GitHub `.md` file

 ## Code Execution
 For running the `.rmd` files the following dependencies are needed:
 * `R` version: 4.1.1
 * `tidyverse` package version: 1.3.1
 * `testhat` package version: 0.2.1
 * `gapminder` package version: 
 * `palmerpenguins` package version: 
 
 These packages are loaded at the beginning of each `.rmd` file. Using IDEs such as `RStudio` is recommended to execute R markdown files by simply knit each `.rmd` and reproducing Github markdown (`.md`) output. The output could be easily changed to the desired format by changing the YAML header in the `.rmd` files.
